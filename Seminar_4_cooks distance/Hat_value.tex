\section{Little Background}
\section{Highly influential  data point}
A data point is said to be influential if when removed from the calculation change the regression line significantly. How influential a data-point is, is the combination of how much leverage it has and how extreme it is in the $y$ direction. However, A data point can have an high leverage but not influential, and it goes the same way for an outlier(all outlier are not influential).
\section{Definition}
Hat-matrix  

\bigskip
The algebraic expression.
$$\hat{y} = Hy$$
Where:\\
$\hat{Y}_j$ is the prediction from the full regression model for observation $j$; \\
$\hat{Y}_{j(i)}$ is The prediction for observation $j$ from a refitted regression model in which observation $i$ has been omitted;


The {\bf leverage} define how far apart is a given data point from the average(mean/median). Points with high leverage tend to pull the regression line toward themselves and have impact on the slop of the regression line hence {\bf influential}.

\section{Interpretation of Hat values}
There are several rules when interpreting {\bf cook's distance}. The widely used criterion is that a point is considered to be highly influential if $D_i > 1$ \citep{weisberg}

Different rules have  been defined such as: $D_i > 8.5$ if $p > 3$ \citep{barry}   where $p$ is the number of regression parameter. \citep{Robert} declares a data-point to be influential when $D_i > \frac{4}{n}$ where $n$ is the number of observation.
\section{Hat values using R}
Packages use:\\ 
\texttt{install.packages (QuantPshyc)}\\
\texttt{library(QuantPshyc)}\\
call Cook's $D_i$ from the library: \texttt{linearmodel.cook()}\\
manually computing cook's distance: \texttt{â€¢}
\section{Discussion}
What to do when a given data-point's $D_i > 1$ ? has an
